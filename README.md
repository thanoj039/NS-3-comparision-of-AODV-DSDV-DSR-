Comparison of AODV,DSDV,DSR protocols with different metrics using NS-3.

Install NS-3

1.Place the "routing-comparisions" folder in 'ns-3-allinone/ns-3-dev/' directory.
2.Run the Python script 'routing-comparisions_script.py' (cmd: 'python3 routing-comparisions_script.py') in the terminal.
3.The trace files are generated and stored in Trace_files folder.
4.Data from the trace files is analyzed and the graphs are plotted and stored in the graphs folder.

Note:
For, AODV and DSDV protocols the trace files are generated and analyzed.
Since, Flowmonitor does not work with DSR protocol, DSR results are obtained from another source and are used here.
